### Command-line Tool for Basic Operations on Quadratic Equations

---

**Latest Update:**  
**Version:** 1.01  
**Changes:** This version introduces an object-oriented approach, utilizing a class to handle quadratic equations instead of standalone functions.

---

### ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Real Roots**: Calculates the real roots (if they exist) of the quadratic equation.
- **Y-Intercept**: Determines the y-intercept value.
- **Vertex**: Finds the vertex of the parabola.
- **Solve for X**: Solves for specific x-values when given.
